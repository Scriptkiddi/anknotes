# Evernote2Anki Importer (beta)
## Description
An Anki plug-in aiming for syncing evernote account with anki directly from anki.
Very rudimentary for the moment. I wait for suggestions according to the needs of evernote/anki users.
## How to use it
- download everything, move it to your Anki/addons directory
- go get your developper token at [this page] (https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action). As this token provide a direct access to your evernote account, keep it private !
- right-click edit options.cfg inside the folder evernoteLib  
- paste your token to complete the evernote_token field
- edit the other files according to your preferences

Forks and suggestions are very welcome.
